/**
 * Serves this package's MCP tools over stdio, as a command of the `simply` CLI.
 *
 * The same server the `simply-gitlab-mcp` binary runs — that binary still exists and still works.
 * This exists so an MCP client can be pointed at `simply` with no separate global install: the
 * plugin is fetched on first use like any other.
 *
 * **Extends `Command` directly, not `GitLabCommand`.** That is deliberate and load-bearing. stdout
 * is the protocol channel here, and the shared base class enables oclif's `--json` flag, which
 * makes oclif print this command's return value to stdout when it is passed. One stray object on
 * that stream corrupts the session, and the client's error would say nothing about why.
